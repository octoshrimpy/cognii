If you're here for hacktoberfest, feel free to add features, content, and issues, or tackle any issues you want! Make that PR and I'll take a look at it. 

If you want something a bit easier to tackle, check out https://github.com/octoshrimpy/boredom-remover-9000, a small app that suggests things to do. :) Thank you for all the help!
